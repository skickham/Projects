Capstone:
NLP
1) elastic search for app/nlp
2) business recs to improve sentiment: price and sentiment
3) sentiment over time
6) demographic and sentiment (possibly from image too)
8) (in MONEY)
11) sentiment by cuisine or city??? (probably not necessary)
14) anything to do with menu? items? descriptions (real bacon)
15) negative review makeup vs. positive review makeup (past tense, people not food, we & us go up-->trauma narratives)
16) consolidate sentiment
17) eliminate or leave in based on votes 
18) business to business similarity


UI/UX
5) how to search: choose by price/min stars/max distance/cuisine/keywords or just straight rec/surprise me option??
9) rank compared to similar restaurants? if phoenix all rate chinese restaurants poorly but you love chinese, where should you go? (not nec cuz you can just see the comparisons)
10) eliminate non-frequently reviewed businesses unless new (or maybe indicate with different colored (gray) location pin)
13) what's hot now feature
17) is user input to rate a couple of nearby restaurants  or fast food rests or ranking/pick top out of 3 
18) Grab a recent tweet about the place using a the tweets geo-location


Show me the MONEY
4) recommendation and checkin to improve recommendation (what did i mean by this?)
7) manager response (or lack thereof) and rating
8) value to yelp?? gives automatic feedback on reviewers sentiment that they can feel free to adjust???? would make data more interesting or train model better....or consolidate sentiment/concept (like trip advisor)
12) predicting which businesses will get more reviews (based on checkins or sentiments or review rate/acceleration)



random:
can we hook up spark to tensor flow so were working in a single environment?
what is the product? what do users input and get as output?
what can NLP contribute to the recommendation? (sentiment analysis or uses for similarity/collaborative filtering)
